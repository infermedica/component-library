# Transitions
Transitions are animations that help users understand the flow on a page.
You can use our ready-to-use transition effects or modify them according to your needs.

## How to use
To use our transition, just surround your component with build-in Vue component ```Transition``` with correct name of animations.<br />
You can check how to use ```Transition``` in <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/transition.html" target="_blank">Vue documentation</a>

For our transitions, we have separate story where you can see how them work.

## Provided Transitions
### Fade
This stylistic effect allows for component in your application to gradually appear or disappear.<br/>
The transition effect can be applied to various elements, such as text, images, or entire sections of a web page, adding a subtle and visually appealing animation to the user interface.

### Slide
A slide transition refers to the animation effect applied to elements when they change position. It gives the illusion of sliding or moving smoothly from one position to another.

### Slide from start
<Canvas of={stories.SlideFromStart} />

### Slide from end
<Canvas of={stories.SlideFromEnd} />

### Slide from bottom
<Canvas of={stories.SlideFromBottom} />

## Changing transitions
If you would like to change exsisting transition, you can override classes that are responsible for the effects.
Replace ```{transition-name}``` with proper ```name``` according to your needs.

- ```.{transition-name}-enter-active```
- ```.{transition-name}-enter-from```
- ```.{transition-name}-leave-active```
- ```.{transition-name}-leave-to```
