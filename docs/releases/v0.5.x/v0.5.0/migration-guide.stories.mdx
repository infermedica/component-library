# v0.5.0 Migration Guide

## .focus-hidden
From v0.5.0 move responsibility for focus visibility handling to the library. You can remove definition of `.focus-is-hidden` from CSS.focus

From v0.5.0 we use class `focus-hidden` to hide focus for mouse users.
```scss
.element {
  &:focus {
    outline: none
  }

  body:not(.focus-hidden) & {
    &:focus {
      box-shadow: var(--focus-outer);
    }
  }
}
```

From v0.5.0 we use `focusElement` helper to focus elements and allow to show focus
```js
import { focusElement } from '@infermedica/component-library/helpers';

const focus(element) {
  const focusVisible = true;
  focusElement(element, focusVisible)
}

## UiNotification
From v0.5.0, default slot in UiNotification contain text for UiAlert.
```html
<UiNotification>
  Thank you. We’ll review this question as soon as possible.
</UiNotification>
```
From v0.5.0, action button in UiNotification is setuped by props.
```html
<UiNotification
  :translation="{
   action: 'Skip this question'
  }"
  :buttonActionAttrs="{
    onClick: ()=> ()
  }"
>
  Thank you. We’ll review this question as soon as possible.
