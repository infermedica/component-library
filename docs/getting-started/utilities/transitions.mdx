# Transitions
Transitions encompass animations that aid users in comprehending the flow within a page.
Our Component Library includes a collection of readily available transition effects, which can be utilized as is or customized to align with your specific requirements.

Few our components use our transitions:
- [UiModal](?path=/docs/organisms-modal--docs)
- [UiSidePanel](?path=/docs/organisms-sidepanel--docs)

## Available transitions
We use 2 animations:
- Fade
- Slide

## How to use
To use our transition, just surround your component with transition with correct name of animations
```html
  <Transition name="fade">
  <slot />
</Transition>
```
Also you can use ```v-bind``` to pass more attributes:
```html
  <Transition v-bind="{ appear: true, name: 'fade' }">
  <slot />
</Transition>
```
For both of our transitions, we have separate story where you can see how it works.

## Changing transitions
If you desire to modify an existing transition, you have the ability to override the classes responsible for the effects.
Replace ```{transition-name}``` with ```fade``` or ```slide``` according to your needs.

- ```.{transition-name}-enter-active```
- ```.{transition-name}-enter-from```
- ```.{transition-name}-leave-active```
- ```.{transition-name}-leave-to```
