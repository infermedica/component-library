# Code Guidelines
The Infermedica Component Library development team has rules to keep the code clean and easy to understand - for all team members.
These rules ensure that the code can be read and improved by a developer other than its original author. Following these rules
will help maintain readability, changeability, extensibility and maintainability. You can read these rules below

<PageOutline/>

## Components rules
### Naming
New component name should be simple to use and be understandable by everyone. Use **Pascal Case** and **prefix** `Ui` for component to avoid naming collision.
```
Ui<ComponentName>
```

### Files structure
We want to follow [atomic design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) methodology. Components are divided into three
levels depending on their complexity (`atoms`, `molecules`, or `organisms`). File structure should look like below.
```
./<atoms | molecules | organisms>
  |__Ui<ComponentName>
    |__Ui<ComponentName>.vue
    |__Ui<ComponentName>.spec.js
    |__Ui<ComponentName>.stories.js
```
- `*.vue` - Vue.js component file. In this file you can find `template`, `script`, `styles` by scss.
- `*.spec.js` - Vitest test file. By default you can find `render test` on it.
- `*.stories.js` - Storybook stories file. By default you can find `common` stories. Read more about [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

### Creating
If you want to create a new component, please follow these steps:
- use script `create:component` - to create new component directory in `src/components/{level}`.
```bash
npm run create:component
```
- choose one of the three component level (`atoms`, `molecules` or `organisms`).
- enter the name of new component - <a href="#naming">naming rules</a>

## CSS
### Naming rules
We want to follow [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) methodology for naming SCSS modifiers and CSS classes.
```
 <block>__<element>--<modifiers>
```
More details you can find in [Theme Configuration](/docs/getting-started-development-guide-theme-configuration--page) guideline.

## Template Rules
- use semantic HTML for example `<a/>` for elements which change the route and `<button/>` for actions.
- use `slots` and `props` for content:
    - `props` should be used only for common case
    - **DO NOT** use `props` for properties that can be set by css
    - provide a slot's to allow template replacement
    - name slots with BEM
    - bind data to slots with `v-bind`
``` html
<slot name="header">
    <UiHeading
        :level="1"
        :title="title"
        :subtitle="subtitle"
    />
</slot>
```

## Deprecation guidelines
We are trying to keep the code clean and easy to understand. Sometimes this leads to changes to the APIs. To avoid breaking changes and make migration process easier,
we are support deprecation to next major version and adding information about deprecations to console log.

**Deprecation process:**
* Add note next to deprecated APIs `@deprecated will be removed in 0.4.0 use ... instead`
* Add note next to deprecated code that should be removed

```js
// TODO: will be removed in 0.4.0 / BEGIN
<code/>
// END

As you can see, we are using `console.warn` only when deprecated API is used.

### Exceptions
In some case we need deprecated APIs in next major version. In this case we will add information to Migration Guide and throw error if deprecated API is used (for all environments).

```js
//TODO: remove in 0.6.0 / BEGIN
const { checkbutton } = slots;
if (checkbutton) {
  throw new Error('[@infermedica/component-library error]: The `checkbotton` slot is deprecated and removed. Please use `checkbox` slot instead.');
}
//END
```

## Unit tests
Unit tests allow you to test individual units of code in isolation. The purpose of unit testing is to provide developers with confidence in their code. By writing thorough,
meaningful tests, you achieve the confidence that as new features are built or your code is refactored your application will remain functional and stable.

We should test the output of the components, not his internal parts. Minimum set of test should be contained components: external API (`props`, `slots`, `emits` and `$events`),
internal API (`methods`). For example, you should check if emit was called, or if the class was added to the element. If you want to test some element, you should get it by
adding attribute `data-testid` to him.

## Stories for Storybook
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) makes development faster and easier by isolating components. This allows you to work on one component at a time. When creating stories, we should:
- make sure everything is working fine. All component functionality should be supported. For example, we can close and open modal component.
- add examples of how to use each slot in a component
- add examples when a component differs significantly in some cases
