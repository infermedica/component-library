# Stories
## Small
If it is necessary to set icons in ```UiTile``` smaller, you can add a modifier ```ui-simple-question--small``` to the component ```UiSimpleQuestion```.
<Canvas of={ UiSimpleQuestionStories.Small } />

## With Tile Slot
By using ```slot```, ```UiSimpleQuestion``` is more flexible and reusable. It is possible to  pass a `tile` template to a component and replace our template.
