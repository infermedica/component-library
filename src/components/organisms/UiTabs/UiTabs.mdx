Tabs are pattern commonly used to organize and display content in a structured and accessible manner. They allow users to switch between different sections, enabling a smoother and more efficient user experience.

Each tab represents a distinct section of content. When a tab is selected, its associated content is displayed while hiding the content of other tabs.

<Canvas of={ UiTabsStories.Basic } />
<Controls of={ UiTabsStories.Basic } />

# Stories
## Fixed
If it is necessary to set tabs to the full width of parent component, you can add a modifier ```ui-tabs-fixed``` to the component ```UiTabs```.
<Canvas of={ UiTabsStories.Fixed } />

## With Default Slot
By using slot, UiTabs is more flexible and reusable. It is possible to  pass a default template to a component, and let the child component render the fragment within its own template.
<Canvas of={ UiTabsStories.WithDefaultSlot } />
